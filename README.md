## Expressions of gratitude
To my Almighty God for giving me this wonderful opportunity and blessing.

I want to thank the entire Spartan DEV study group, especially the creator of this initiative, Oliver Prada and Maykel Cepeda, without whose help and collaboration I would not have been able to achieve this precious first goal.

Oliver, Maykel, Hel√≠, see you soon at Hard Rock or wherever you like, I'll pay.
